# Auto Git Commit
 
A very simple script-like Python program, that will commit every change in tracked repos when run. Currently it doesn't check for anything, so be sure to enter correct paths for repos. Repos paths are included in repos.txt, located in same folder as main.py.

WARNING: non-latin characters are not officially supported, and will probably break. Check the logs and do the tests before leaving it alone!

It does not have any scheduling built-in, it will just try to commit when run and exit immediately, but you can use Windows task scheduler or any other things to automate it.
